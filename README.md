# Overview

Do you want to create and download your own countdown video on Android?
Well, now you can, for free.

**Adding countdown timer has never been easier,** especially on an Android.
There are no apps or websites to create AND customise a countdown video.
That's when I got an idea to make this app. Not only can you generate a countdown video based on the user input, but you can also customise it.
